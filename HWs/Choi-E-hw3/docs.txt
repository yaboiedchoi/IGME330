Initially, I wanted to do some sort of "chat bot" where the dropdown selects your question and the robot will answer, using a audio visualizer as the mouth. 

First, I disabled all the selectors (for now)
this includes show gradient, bars, circles, noise, invert colors, and emboss-cb

The only thing that will be constant is the robot face. 

added eyes, which are a gradient of red in the middle-bottom, and black on the edges. Yes, this is a HAL 9000 reference. 
added trapezoid eyelids that jump up and down with the overall average audio. 

Added a bar based mouth that goes off of byte frequency data

added a button to choose whether the robot is using byte frequency or byte time domain data.

added high shelf filter and low shelf filter

move it to voices

moved eyelids to class system

moved eyeballs to the class system

eyeball color now pulsates along with the audio

all sliders are vertical now, to fit more


added eyeball color sliders, default is white

added json reader, reads title, file names / paths, and default volume value.
