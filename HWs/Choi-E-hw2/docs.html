Initially, I wanted to do some sort of "chat bot" where the dropdown selects your question and the robot will answer, using a audio visualizer as the mouth. 

First, I disabled all the selectors (for now)
this includes show gradient, bars, circles, noise, invert colors, and emboss-cb

The only thing that will be constant is the robot face.
