Initially, I wanted to do some sort of "chat bot" where the dropdown selects your question and the robot will answer, using a audio visualizer as the mouth. 

First, I disabled all the selectors (for now)
this includes show gradient, bars, circles, noise, invert colors, and emboss-cb

The only thing that will be constant is the robot face. 

added eyes, which are a gradient of red in the middle-bottom, and black on the edges. Yes, this is a HAL 9000 reference. 
added trapezoid eyelids that jump up and down with the overall average audio. 

Added a bar based mouth that goes off of byte frequency data

added a button to choose whether the robot is using byte frequency or byte time domain data.
